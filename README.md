# Password-Strength-Checker
A simple tool that checks the strength of a password based on length, character variety, and common patterns.

How Weak Passwords Are a Security Risk:

Weak passwords are a critical security vulnerability because they can be easily guessed or cracked using brute-force or dictionary attacks. Attackers often exploit weak passwords to gain unauthorized access to accounts, leading to data breaches, identity theft, or system compromise. The more predictable or short a password is, the easier it is for malicious actors to break in.

Best Practices Applied:

In the project, I applied several password strength criteria:

Minimum length of 8 characters (to prevent brute-force attacks).
Inclusion of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters, ensuring complexity.
Feedback to improve weak passwords.
These practices align with best practices to ensure password strength and reduce the chances of successful cyberattacks.
